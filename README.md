# Project 1 - *Flicks*

# Only the set up part of the assignment has been completed.

**Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **4** hours.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] All images fade in as they are loading.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I want to implement another part to the app so the user can buy the tickets directly through it.
2. I'd also like to discuss more about animations.

## Video Walkthrough
