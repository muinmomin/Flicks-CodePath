Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I want to add trailers to this app
2. When a user clicks on a pin on the map, they should be able to purchase tickets from that theater location
